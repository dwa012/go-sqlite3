Work in progress.

pkg/db
	Generic database API for Go that supports
	multiple database systems.

pkg/db/sqlite3
	Database driver enabling access to SQLite
	from Go.

These are in flux constantly, don't rely on them
yet. Discussions regarding the generic API happen
mostly on golang-nuts@googlegroups.com for now.

Special thanks to Eden Li and Masaaki Yonebayashi.
